Being one of the Libre Graphics Meeting organizers, during the past few days, I've been reading the feedback the LGM participants are doing.

Here are some thoughts about them:

- Is web design a topic for the Libre Graphics Meeting? There are already several amazing conferences on the topic and most are already close to the idea of free software. And do we have tools made for web designers?

- Not enough talks for the developers. I share this opinion, and it was a pain to hear a presenter excuse himself because his talk was getting technical. We have a hard time to get people to present good technical talks, but this is defenitively something I want to work on. Generally, speaking, there seem to be a wish for more technical depth in the talks.

- Better help people to get people to get together and get things done (as wells as artists, as programmers or as other parts of the community). Make live coding visible?

- Are the 10-20 minutes talks the right format?

- We should find a good way to bring over what each project has done and what it plans to do next year. Do we need a specific session with mostly lightning talks?

- Most people tend to appreciate the direct communication between users and developers

- Grouping the talks by topics seems to be appreciated.

- Several workshops could not be correctly done, because the participants didn't have everything needed already installed

- We should probably better define what LT, ST, and talks are for...

- The schedule is seen as corret to too dense. Several people most value the interaction among people and it was a bit not enough, between talks and workshops...
  Generally speaking, that it was ok for people not deeply involved in LG projects (or newcomers) and too much for the people who are involved.

- The DYI spirit in the organization is good, but there should be a better communication to the world (most of all for the results).

- People want more from Blender... but how can we get the Blender guys to be interested and – most of all – what do we have to offer? (At least, nobody noticed that Scribus was missing...)

- The LGM should be more than just a showcase for new software features and issues. We need micro and macro views of the communities involved in libre graphics.

- More practitioners explaining how they work, use or write software in such or such a way. That might help creating stronger relationship, common workshpace, dialogue, between devs and users.

- It seams that type design should be one of the main topics of the LGM. The same for Animation.

- Starting late and finishing late is not preferred by everybody...

- The "academic" talks (key notes) are welcome.

- Make more publicity and get more people from the free culture / digital culture / digital art /makers scene
